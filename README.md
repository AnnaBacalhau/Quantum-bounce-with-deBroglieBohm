# Quantum-bounce-with-deBroglieBohm
This code calculates de background evolution of a cosmological model
in which the canonical quantization of gravity is used to model the
final stages of the contraction phase. The De Broglie-Bohm formulation of quantum mechanics is used to calculate the scale factor and the scalar field evolution.
